# Terraform Engine

Status: ALPHA

Terraform Engine is a framework to jump start your organization onto GCP. It is
a Terraform module generator that puts together Terraform resources and modules
into deployments complete with values for your infrastructure.

## Why?

Users hosting any type of sensitive data on GCP typically need to go through a
few common and repetitive processes such as setting up devops, auditing and
monitoring. By using our out of the box complete end-to-end configs that
implement these steps for you, you can quickly setup a secure and compliant
environment and focus on the parts of the infrastructure that drive your
business.

This tool will help you follow Terraform
[best practices](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/evolving-infrastructure-terraform-opencredo),
by using the popular open source tool
[Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) to define smaller modular configs
rather than monolithic modules that quickly get out of hand or need a custom
pipeline to manage.

Our templates use Google's best practice modules from the
[Cloud Foundation Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit).

Use our [sample](./samples) configs to quickly get started.

## Requirements

-   [Terraform 0.12+](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
-   [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases)
-   [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
-   [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)

## Usage

The engine takes a path to an input config and a path to output the generated
Terraform configs. After the output has been generated, there is no dependency
on the engine any longer, and the user can directly use the `terraform` and
`terragrunt` binaries to deploy the infrastructure.

Replace the values in [samples/simple.yaml](./samples/simple.yaml) with values
for your infrastructure, then run the following commands:

```
# Step 1: Clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare
$ cd healthcare/deploy/engine

# Step 2: Setup helper env vars
$ ENGINE_ROOT=$PWD
$ CONFIG_PATH=$PWD/samples/simple.yaml
$ OUTPUT_PATH=/tmp/engine

# Step 3: Generate Terraform configs.
# Edit config with values of your infra.
$ nano $CONFIG_PATH
$ bazel run :main -- --config_path=$CONFIG_PATH --output_path=$OUTPUT_PATH

# Step 4: Run one time bootstrap to setup devops project to host Terraform state.
$ cd $OUTPUT_PATH/bootstrap
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply

# Step 5: Deploy Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
# resources by following the instructions in components/cicd/README.md in this
# directory or $OUTPUT_PATH/cicd/README.md in the generated Terraform configs
# directory.

# After the above is done. Your devops project and CICD pipelines are ready, and
# following changes should be made as Pull Requests (PRs) and go though code
# reviews. Once approval is granted and CI tests pass, merge the PR. The CD job
# will automatically deploy the change to your GCP infra.

# Step 6: Deploy org infrastructure and other resources by sending a PR for
# local changes to the config repo.

# Step 7: If a `DISABLED` block is present in the config, follow the steps for
# all fields within the block and deploy the changes. Remove the `DISABLES`
# block from the config once done.

# Step 8 (Optional): Modify and/or add deployments as needed...
$ cd $OUTPUT_PATH/org/.../example-deployment
# And then send the change as a PR.
```

## Tips

-   Before running `terragrunt apply-all` always run `terragrunt plan-all` and
    carefully review the output. The CICD will create a trigger to generate the
    plan. Look for the values of the known fields to ensure they are what you
    expect. You may see some values with the word "mock" in them. These values
    are coming from other deployments and will be filled with the real value
    once Terragrunt runs the dependent deployment.

-   If you plan on using the engine again, do not manually modify any generated
    file as it will be overwritten the next time the engine runs. Instead,
    prefer to change the input config, recipe or component for the generated
    files and add new resources under new deployments that are not generated by
    the engine.

-   Always backup any engine configs as well as the generated Terraform configs
    and any modifications to the Terraform configs to version control.
