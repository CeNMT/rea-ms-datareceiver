# DataFlow Pub/Sub to HCAPI Streaming Pipeline

The goal of this DataFlow streaming pipeline (Classic standalone deployment) is to consume messages via Google Pub/Sub, transform raw JSON messages to FHIR resource as per U.S Core Implementation Guide (Preferential) and POST new created FHIR resources to Healthcare API (HCAPI R4 FHIR store) for further reconciliation ingestion via Heathcare Data Engine or standalone FHIR Store which can be used for downstream application. 
This solution is built using Google Cloud tools and services, such as Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Healthcare Api and Google Cloud Storage. This pipeline will help users accelerate deploying streaming data pipelines from Pub/Sub to Healthcare API enabling users to transform their raw data to FHIR resources where streaming application is applicable.
