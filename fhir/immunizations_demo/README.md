# Deprecation

This demo was written 4 years ago to show the capabilities of the Google FHIR
store, and show interested users how they might incorporate the FHIR API into
a frontend app. Since then, many improvements and new features have been added
to the Cloud Healthcare API, and Angular. The technical maintenance of this
demo is not feasible, and as a result we will be removing this code on or after
August 15, 2023.

For up to date guides on using the FHIR API refer to our documentation. Guides
are available for [managing FHIR
resources](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources),
[searches](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/fhir-search),
[batch/transaction
bundles](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/fhir-bundles) and
more.
